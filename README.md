Hello!

I'm RedImperator, former Stardestroyer.net big fish, occasional SV contributor, Facebook shitposter, insurance industry parasite, and Star Trek fan. A long time ago, I started on a little side project: rewrite the pilot episode of Star Trek: _Voyager_ as a novella length story, keeping the same characters and overall plot elements, but taking my own approach to it. My commitment to the project has waxed and waned since then, but it's always been lurking in the back of my mind somewhere, and a few weeks ago I decided to buckle down and finally finish it.

The story is finished, proofread, and converted to bbcode. I'll be posting it in sections, both at Sufficient Velocity and at Stardestroyer.net, starting with the Prologue tonight, Part I tomorrow, and the remaining four parts every three days after that. If you've read previous drafts of this on SDN, much of this will be familiar; I tried to tighten things down a bit, and clear up some creeping Treknobabble from the middle acts, but it's the same story as before. If you haven't, and the idea of reading an amateur rewrite of a mediocre TV show from 20 years ago is your idea of a good time, then I hope you enjoy it. For ease of reading, once I upload new parts I'll edit in links so you can jump quickly from section to section without searching through the comments thread (assuming, of course, that there is one).

Post Script: 

Why do this at all? Allow me to quote myself from my last crack at finishing this:

> So why do this anyway? 

> _Voyager_ has always been something of a punching bag. While the production values of the show were quite high, especially by mid-90s broadcast standards, and the acting was (generally) reasonably good, it was notorious for poor writing that often shied away from the implications of the show's premise. At the same time that shows like _The Sopranos_ were resetting the bar for American television drama, and _Voyager_'s own Trek predecessor, _Deep Space Nine_ was showing that in-depth characterization and multi-season plot arcs were possible in a Trek series, _Voyager_'s creative team stuck doggedly to the weekly adventure show formula. Compounding the problem were weak early season villains (the Kazon), an unfortunate tendency to resort to contrivances to resolve the weekly plot (starting in the very first episode), and the writers' obvious fear of their own premise. 

> But underneath all of it, the show had a lot of potential, and if a better creative team had had control, I really do think that _Voyager_ could have been _Star Trek_'s contribution to the current Golden Age of American television--a show that could be mentioned in the same breath as _The Sopranos_, _The Wire_, _Breaking Bad_ or _Mad Men_. Or at the very least been as good as TNG and DS9. I wanted to try to write a pilot that would live up to that potential. I don't know if I succeeded, but I do think it's a pretty good story.

I wrote that in 2012 (!) and stand by it now. I think _Voyager_ could have been a great show. I don't know if I could have been a great TV writer, but I think what I've got here is pretty good.
